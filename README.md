# Dementia_Risk_Prediction

Dementia is a general term for memory loss and decline in thinking and cognitive abilities in a person. We might have seen what is dementia and its effects especially in the older people around us.

The WHO website states that “Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia, with nearly 60% living in low-and middle-income countries. Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases.”
Future prediction of data suggests that it might reach 82 million by the end of 2030. Here, we would also like to highlight that nearly 60-70 % of the dementia cases are with respect to Alzheimer’s Disease. It should be noted that Dementia is not only with respect to older people but even the young population gets surrendered to this disease. This phenomenon is known as young-onset dementia (age < 65 years) and constitutes around 9 % of the data on dementia related cases.

There is no cure for dementia yet; hence, the early identification of individuals at higher risk of developing dementia becomes critical, as this may provide a window of opportunity to adopt lifestyle changes to reduce risk of this diseaese.

We intend to do a small service to hospitals, clinicians, nursing facilities and other healthcare practitioners by modelling a machine learning classification problem that helps in predicting the risk of Dementia given a certain set of features.

The complete dataset details, methodology and model building details can be found in the 'final_report' pdf file.

The model is deployed on Heroku Cloud.
